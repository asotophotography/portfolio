      <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Photography is my way of capturing emotions, moments, and stories that words often fail to express.
        It allows me to communicate my perspective. In the process of creating my work, I draw inspiration
        from other photographers, as well as the beauty of everyday life. I focus on composition, lighting,
        and the authenticity of a moment to express my vision. Photography, being a quick art form, allows
        me to preserve moments. By doing this work, I strive to diversify my work and try new things.
        Iâ€™ve been recently doing a lot of nature photography.
