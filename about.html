<p>
Hi, Iâ€™m Adrian Soto. Iâ€™m 15 years old and a freshman at El Capitan High School. I got into photography through class, but itâ€™s turned into something I really enjoy, almost like a new way of seeing things. I like being able to take something ordinary and make it look interesting or emotional just by how I frame it or what I focus on.

I usually find inspiration in nature, cities, and people, just random things that catch my eye. Iâ€™ve been trying different styles and learning how to use lighting, angles, and editing to make my photos stand out.

Outside of photography, I like hanging out with friends and doing anything creative. This portfolio shows some of my favorite work from this year and how much Iâ€™ve learned along the way.

      <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Photography is my way of capturing emotions, moments, and stories that words often fail to express.
        It allows me to communicate my perspective. In the process of creating my work, I draw inspiration
        from other photographers, as well as the beauty of everyday life. I focus on composition, lighting,
        and the authenticity of a moment to express my vision. Photography, being a quick art form, allows
        me to preserve moments. By doing this work, I strive to diversify my work and try new things.
        Iâ€™ve been recently doing a lot of nature photography.
