    <h3>Skystopper</h3>
    <p>I took this photo because the sunset light behind the traffic light created strong contrast. The traffic light became a dark silhouette while the sky stayed bright and glowing. I liked how the lens flare added a soft effect across the image. The red light and bright sun showed a mix of natural and ma -made color and form.

    <h3>Lonely Shed</h3>
    <p>I took this photo because the shed stood out in the empty field. I used centered composition and open space to make it feel isolated. The worn wood adds texture, and the soft light brings out the shadows in the walls. The shedâ€™s shape and angle also help show its form and age.

    <h3>Solitude is Bliss</h3>
    <p>I took this photo because the single yellow flower stood out so clearly from the green leaves. I used fill the frame to bring attention to its bold color and shape. The bright lighting made the petals glow and brought out the shiny texture in the leaves. The flower's position and space around it made it feel peaceful and alone in a good way.

  <div class="favorite-description">
    <h3>Gaze</h3>
    <p>I took this photo because the light hit the subjectâ€™s face in a strong and calm way. I used natural lighting to highlight the skin and shadows for depth. The tree and post help create framing, drawing attention to the center. The pose and angle give the photo a confident and peaceful feeling.

    <h3>Paranoia</h3>
    <p>I took this photo because the thick fog made the street look quiet and empty. The soft lighting and low visibility flattened the scene and made the objects feel distant. I used space to show how the fog pushed everything back and softened the background. The muted color and simple shapes made the mood feel still and a little eerie.
