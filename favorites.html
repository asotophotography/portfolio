    <h3>Skystopper</h3>
    <p>During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, a lone individual stood unarmed in front of a column of tanks. This act of courage became a global symbol of resistance and the power of peaceful protest.</p>

    <h3>Lonely Shed</h3>
    <p>Captured by Voyager 1 from 3.7 billion miles away, this photo shows Earth as a faint pixel suspended in a sunbeam. It reminds us of the fragility of our world and the shared responsibility to care for it.</p>

  <img src="images/pictures/macro/17.jpg" alt="Robert Oppenheimer by Yousuf Karsh" class="favorite-image">
  <div class="favorite-description">
    <h3>Solitude is Bliss</h3>
    <p>In this powerful portrait, Karsh captures not just the face of a scientist, but the burden of a legacy. Known as the "father of the atomic bomb," Oppenheimer's brilliance and moral conflict are palpable, the weight of creation, consequence, and regret written into his gaze. This photograph transcends biography, becoming a visual meditation on ethics, responsibility, and the dual nature of human achievement.</p>

    <h3>Gaze</h3>
    <p>In 1963, Thích Quảng Đức set himself on fire in Saigon in protest of religious persecution. The image stunned the world and remains a haunting reminder of the lengths individuals will go for justice.</p>

  <img src="images/pictures/off_campus/14.jpg" alt="Earthrise" class="favorite-image">
  <div class="favorite-description">
    <h3>Paranoia</h3>
    <p>Snapped by astronaut William Anders during the Apollo 8 mission, Earthrise was the first photograph to capture our planet from the vantage point of the Moon. It revealed Earth as a vibrant, living world adrift in darkness, fragile, finite, and shared by all. The image not only marked a milestone in space exploration, but also shifted humanity’s perspective, fueling the birth of the modern environmental movement and awakening a global sense of interconnectedness.</p>
