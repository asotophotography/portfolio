    <h3>Robert Oppenheimer by Yousuf Karsh</h3>
    <p>In this powerful portrait, Karsh captures not just the face of a scientist, but the burden of a legacy. Known as the "father of the atomic bomb," Oppenheimer's brilliance and moral conflict are palpable, the weight of creation, consequence, and regret written into his gaze. This photograph transcends biography, becoming a visual meditation on ethics, responsibility, and the dual nature of human achievement.</p>

    <h3>Earthrise</h3>
    <p>Snapped by astronaut William Anders during the Apollo 8 mission, Earthrise was the first photograph to capture our planet from the vantage point of the Moon. It revealed Earth as a vibrant, living world adrift in darkness, fragile, finite, and shared by all. The image not only marked a milestone in space exploration, but also shifted humanity‚Äôs perspective, fueling the birth of the modern environmental movement and awakening a global sense of interconnectedness.</p>
